        <h3>Data protection</h3>
        <p>The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence,
            we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
            protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.</p>
        <p>Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises
            data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we
            collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the
            information is collected.</p>
        <p>We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications)
            may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.</p>
        <h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)</h3>
        <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>

        <p>Phone: 01741728493<br />
            E-mail: kontakt&#64;jan-holtschke.de</p>
        <p>The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
            decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail
            addresses, etc.).</p>

        <h3>Storage duration</h3>
        <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will
            remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified
            request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have
            other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention
            periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
        <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>
        <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or
            Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case
            of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based
            on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in
            your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25
            (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a
            contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
            6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it
            on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our
            legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the relevant legal basis in each
            individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
        <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
        <p>In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also
            requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external
            parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so
            (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant
            to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors,
            we only disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the
            case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>
        <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
        <p>A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
            revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness
            of any data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.</p>
        <h3>Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
            GDPR)</h3>
        <p>IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY
            TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION.
            THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY
            PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE
            WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING
            PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
            OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
            PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
        <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
            OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME.
            THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU
            OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION
            PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>
        <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
        <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
            agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
            the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any
            other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses.</p>
        <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
        <p>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment
            of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should
            demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically
            feasible.</p>
        <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
        <p>Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your

            this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any
            time.</p>
        <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
        <p>You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
            concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies
            in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
                some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
                to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
                demand the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
            </li>
            <li>If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
                entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
                instead of its eradication.</li>
            <li>If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be
                weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the
                right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
            archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal
            entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public
            interest reasons cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU.</p>
        <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
        <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
            inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
            program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
            switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
            the browser line.</p>
        <p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
        <h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
        <p>We herewith object to the use of contact information published in conjunction with the mandatory information
            to be provided in our Site Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have not expressly
            requested. The operators of this website and its pages reserve the express right to take legal action in the

        <p>The processing of these data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR, if your request is related to the execution of a

        <p>If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
            request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these

            processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the effective handling of inquiries submitted to us
            (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been obtained; the consent
